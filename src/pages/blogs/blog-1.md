I never thought I’d feel invisible in a room full of friends. Yet here I am—scrolling through messages, seeing group chats I’m barely in, and wondering if I even belong.

## Nights Are the Hardest

– **Silence at midnight** feels louder than any crowd noise.  
– **Notifications** buzz, but none ever seem meant for me.  
– **Memories** of laughter fade into what-ifs: _What if I’d spoken up? What if I’d reached out first?_

## Coping, Kind of

I’ve tried all the usual fixes:

1. **New playlists** on repeat until I drown out the quiet.  
2. **Late-night coding** sessions—lines of code keep me company, at least for a while.  
3. **Walking the empty streets**, headphones in, pretending the world around me takes notice.

Sometimes these work. Other times, they only remind me how far I am from someone who truly cares.

## Small Victories

- Woke up early and watched the sunrise on my balcony.  
- Hit “publish” on that long-overdue blog post.  
- Sent a random “hey, how are you?” message—to no reply, but at least I tried.

## A Thought to Hold On To

Even if nobody checks in on me today, I can still check in on **myself**. I can reach for my goals, learn something new, build a small corner of the internet where my voice matters. And maybe, just maybe, someone will find it and say, “I get that.”

So here’s to the invisible — writing in the margins, breathing between lines, waiting for change. You’re not truly alone; you’re just on your own chapter.

Go has won many fans for its simplicity, speed, and built‑in tooling. 
Yet real‑world development often 
exposes a few sharp edges. Below are some of the more common pain 
points you might run into.
<pre>


</pre>
## 1. Repetitive Error Checks  
Because Go doesn’t have exceptions, every operation that can fail must 
be followed by an explicit check. 
That pattern ensures reliability, but it can also scatter boilerplate 
throughout your code and interrupt 
the flow of business logic.
<pre>


</pre>
## 2. Generics Are Still Maturing  
Introduced in Go 1.18, generics help reduce duplication—but the feature 
set is more limited than in other 
languages. You’ll sometimes need workarounds or helper libraries, and 
type parameters can feel verbose 
until you develop conventions.
<pre>


</pre>
## 3. A Minimal Standard Library  
Go’s standard toolbox is rock‑solid yet intentionally small. You won’t 
find an ORM, workflow engine, or 
advanced HTTP router baked in. Building richer applications requires 
curating a suite of external packages 
and keeping them up to date.
<pre>


</pre>
## 4. Interface Pitfalls  
Go’s duck‑typed interfaces offer flexibility, but that same freedom can 
lead to accidental mismatches. 
Typos or unused methods slip by until runtime. Large, generic 
interfaces can also blur module boundaries 
if not managed carefully.
<pre>


</pre>
## 5. Debugging and Diagnostics  
The default panic output is terse, and reflection‑heavy code may hide 
errors until they surface in 
production. To get full stack traces or step through execution, you’ll 
need to adopt additional 
tools—adding to your learning curve.
<pre>


</pre>
## 6. Large Binaries & Cross‑Build Quirks  
Statically linked executables simplify deployment, but they can become 
surprisingly large. Turning on CGO 
to use C libraries also breaks automatic cross‑compilation, and 
differences between glibc and musl 
environments can trigger unexpected runtime issues.
<pre>

Despite these trade‑offs, Go’s core philosophy of clarity and 
performance continues to shine for many 
service‑oriented projects. Knowing these limitations up front helps you 
plan better, choose the right 
libraries, and avoid surprises down the road.
